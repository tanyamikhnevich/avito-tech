# Reflection

It was a weekly project created as a test task for the Avito team. The goals of the project included the use of technologies learned up to this point.

This project implements React, React Router v5, Redux Toolkit, Axios, TypeScript and a significant amount of Mantine, TSX and CSS, Framer Motion technologies. I decided to use the create-react-app template to keep the initial setup to a minimum and spend more time diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
